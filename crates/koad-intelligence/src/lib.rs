//! # KoadOS Intelligence (L4 Cognition)
//! 
//! This crate provides the "Brain" interface for the Citadel. It abstracts LLM 
//! interactions into a unified [`InferenceClient`] trait and provides a task-based 
//! [`InferenceRouter`] to balance between local (Ollama) and cloud (Gemini) providers.
//!
//! ## Core Components
//! - **InferenceClient**: The primary trait for chat, summarization, and scoring.
//! - **OllamaClient**: Local-first implementation targeting the Ollama API.
//! - **InferenceRouter**: Orchestrates task delegation based on priority and cost.
